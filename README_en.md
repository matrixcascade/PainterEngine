PainterEngine is a cross-platform graphics engine written in C language, with support for Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, WebAssembly, and even bare-metal embedded platforms without OS. It is built on a component-based design pattern, making it accessible to even C language beginners. [PainterEngine Make](https://www.painterengine.com/) enables you to compile your PainterEngine project for multiple platforms with just one click.
It covers various fields including basic data structures, graphics, acoustics, digital signal processing, compiler design, virtual machine systems, cryptography, human-computer interaction, game engines, FPGA-GPU graphics acceleration, and more. You can use it to create mini-applications or as a learning project for acquiring knowledge.

## 30-Second Quick Start Guide to PainterEngine

To incorporate PainterEngine into your project, all you need is:
```c
#include "PainterEngine.h"
```

Utilize `PainterEngine_Initialize` to swiftly create a graphical interactive interface:
```c
#include "PainterEngine.h"
int main()
{
    PainterEngine_Initialize(800, 600);
    return 1;
}
```

Create components or even craft your own:

```c
#include "PainterEngine.h"
int main()
{
    PainterEngine_Initialize(800, 600);
    PX_Object_Firework01Create(mp, root, 200, 600);
    PX_Object_Firework01Create(mp, root, 400, 600);
    PX_Object_Firework01Create(mp, root, 600, 600);
    return 1;
}
```

Use ["PainterEngine Make"](https://www.painterengine.com/) to quickly compile and deploy your project to various platforms such as Windows, Linux, WebAssembly, Android, and more. One-click compilation and deployment, with no need to modify the source code, enabling seamless portability at zero cost.

## Swift development and smooth transitions

If you don't need the one-key compilation feature provided by PainterEngine Make and prefer to develop PainterEngine programs or components using your preferred IDE, you just need to:

1. Add all the code from "PainterEngine/core", "PainterEngine/kernel", and "PainterEngine/runtime" to your project.

2. Select your working platform in "PainterEngine/platform" (eg: choose "PainterEngine/platform/windows" for Windows), and add all the code from the corresponding folder to your project.

3. Include the directory containing PainterEngine source code in your project's include directories.

4. Add your code to the project.

You can now use your IDE to compile PainterEngine with these steps. PainterEngine library will strive to ensure consistent results across all platforms. What you develop on Windows will yield consistent results on Android, web, Linux, iOS, and more.

## Not just a graphics library but also an application framework.
